#Hypertension in the elderly

“At old age, mild hypertension may increase cognitive performance” {Anson and Paran, 2005, Am J Ther, 12, 359-65}

“Results from HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) showed that, at 2-year follow-up, antihypertensive drug therapy with indapamide, plus perindopril if needed, reduced fatal or nonfatal stroke by 30%, fatal stroke by 39%, all-cause mortality by 21%, cardiovascular death by 23%, and heart failure by 64%. These results indicate that hypertensive patients aged 80 years and older should be treated with antihypertensive drugs.” {Aronow, 2008, Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc Med, 5, 514-5}

Treatment of persons over 80 who had sustained systolic BP of 160 mm Hg or higher to a target BP of 150/80 mm Hg led to significant reductions in strokes, death, and heart failure {Beckett et al., 2008, N Engl J Med, 358, 1887-98}

“Cognitively normal subjects with HTN (n=19) had decreased rCBF in the putamen, globus pallidus, bilaterally, and in the left hippocampus compared with normotensives (n=22). In addition, decreased rCBF was observed in the right and left anterior cingulate gyrus with extension to the subcallosal region, left posterior cingulate gyrus and medial precuneus, left lateral inferior and superior frontal, and inferior parietal, left orbitofrontal, and left superior temporal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: rCBF is affected in normal subjects with HTN, not only in the subcortical regions, but also in limbic and paralimbic structures. We hypothesize that the HTN creates a vulnerability state for the development of neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer disease.” {Dai et al., 2008, Stroke, 39, 349-54}

In the Syst-Eur trial, patients over 60 with isolated systolic hypertension (blood pressure when seated of 160-219 mm Hg systolic and below 95 mm Hg diastolic) were treated with up to three drugs to reduce systolic BP by at least 20 mm Hg to reach a value below 150 mm Hg. Active treatment reduced incidence of dementia by 50%, compared to placebo, during a median followup by ITT. In the active treatment group, BP decreased by 8.3 mm Hg systolic and 3.8 mm Hg diastolic. On average, MMSE scores did not change in either group. {Forette et al., 1998, Lancet, 352, 1347-51}

A meta-analysis of outcomes of treatment with antihypertensive drugs for patients aged 80 and over found  that treatment prevented strokes and heart failure, but did not reduce mortality {Gueyffier et al., 1999, Lancet, 353, 793-6}

In a study of Nigerian elderly hypertensive patients, diastolic blood pressure was found to correlate negatively with cognitive performance {Imarhiagbe et al., 2005, Afr J Med Med Sci, 34, 269-73}

“In the oldest old, high blood pressure is not a risk factor for mortality, irrespective of a history of hypertension. Blood pressure values below 140/70 mmHg are associated with excess mortality.” {van  Bemmel et al., 2006, J Hypertens, 24, 287-92}

“In a cohort of very old, hypertensive veterans, in subjects with controlled BPs, subjects with lower BP levels had a lower 5-year survival than those with higher BPs. This suggests that clinicians should use caution in their approach to BP lowering in this age group.” {Oates et al., 2007, J Am Geriatr Soc, 55, 383-8}

“findings support the existence of a link between low blood pressure and higher levels of depressive symptomatology, and also a range of somatic and psychosocial symptoms.” {Stroup-Benham et al., 2000, J Am Geriatr Soc, 48, 250-5}

Adhering to clinical practice guidelines for chronic conditions may lead to undesirable effects when caring for elderly patients with several comorbidities {Boyd et al., 2005, JAMA, 294, 716-24}

“In men aged 75 and over low diastolic blood pressure was associated with the greatest all cause (p=0.04) and cardiovascular (p=0.02) mortality and higher diastolic blood pressure predicted survival.” {Langer et al., 1989, BMJ, 298, 1356-7}

“Older people taking CCBs were significantly more likely than those using other agents to experience cognitive decline.” {Maxwell et al., 1999, CMAJ, 161, 501-6}

“Antihypertensive treatment may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in elderly men with treated diastolic blood pressures < or = 90 mm Hg.” {Merlo et al., 1996, BMJ, 313, 457-61}

In the HYVET study, “Antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients does not statistically reduce incidence of dementia.” {Peters et al., 2008, Lancet Neurol, 7, 683-9}

A study of 385 individuals (2/3 female) average age 83, looked at systolic blood pressure (SBP) and MMSE scores over 4 years of followup. A medical history of arterial hypertension was associated with lower MMSE scores and a higher prevalence of dementia and cognitive decline at baseline. However, intact cognition through the observation period was associated with higher baseline SBP. This relationship also remained when the frailty of aging subjects, indicated by remaining time to death, was taken into account. Conclusions: Lower SBP in the oldest old is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment even after adjustment for compromised vitality. {Nilsson et al., 2007, Aging Clin Exp Res, 19, 41-7}
